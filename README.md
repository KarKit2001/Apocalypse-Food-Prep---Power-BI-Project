## üìñ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to utilize Power BI to analyze and visualize data for efficient food shopping decisions during an apocalyptic scenario by exploring cost trends for various products across different stores to determine the most economical shopping strategy, including 1. identifying the store offering the best overall value and 2. assessing whether specific products are more cost-effective at particular stores.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
Data Source Integration:

Imported data from an Excel workbook into Power BI.
Data Transformation:

Cleaned and filtered data using Power Query Editor.
Renamed columns for better readability and usability.
Removed irrelevant data (e.g., filtered out "milk" due to perishability).
Data Visualization:

Created visualizations to compare spending trends across stores and products:
Stacked Column Chart: Total spend per store.
Clustered Column Chart: Price comparison per product across stores.
Added data labels and titles to improve readability.
Interactive Dashboard:

Designed an intuitive layout for visualizations to answer key questions:
Which store offers the best prices overall?
Should specific products be purchased from different stores for maximum savings?

## üîç Insights
Best Store Overall: Costco offers the best prices for most products.

Product-Specific Trends:
Costco has the best prices for dried beans, bottled water, and canned vegetables.

Target offers the lowest prices for rice, making it a better option for this product.

## üåü Future Improvements
Incorporate additional stores or products for more comprehensive analysis.

Use DAX calculations to create dynamic metrics (e.g., total savings by store).

Design more advanced dashboards with slicers for interactive filtering.
